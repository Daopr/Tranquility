Tranquility
===========

Night vision for programmers. Work well in the dark. For OSX 10.9.

Orginally Created by Nicholas Jitkoff as Nocturne, and distributed through https://code.google.com/p/blacktree-nocturne. I fell in love with this program when someone was using it at WWDC a few years ago. I was sad to discover that OSX 10.9 broke it and that Nicholas was no longer maintaining it.

I am hoping that a new name and an update to make it run will breathe new life into it.

Note: Please do not run Flux (http://justgetflux.com/) at the same time. They currently conflict, and they probably will continue to conflict! Also, if any Flux devs want to help us out by sharing what they're doing internally, that would be awesome! Some users are noting that this does not work on an external monitor.
