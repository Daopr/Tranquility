Tranquility
===========

Night vision for programmers. Work well in the dark. For OSX 10.9.

Orginally Created by Nicholas Jitkoff as Nocturne, and distributed through https://code.google.com/p/blacktree-nocturne. I fell in love with this program when someone was using it at WWDC a few years ago. I was sad to discover that OSX 10.9 broke it and that Nicholas was no longer maintaining it.

I am hoping that a new name and an update to make it run will breathe new life into it.
